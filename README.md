The goal of `{labor}` is to keep your project folder structurated, tidy
and to sync it easily to local folders.

The package works only on MacOs systems.

# Installation

Download the package in a local folder and then run the following code.

``` r
devtools::install_local("path_to_package")
```

Alternatively, you can install it directly from github.

``` r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("c1au6i0/lavor")
```
